## **📖 Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**  

This lesson includes **three notebooks** that introduce key radar concepts:  

1. 📡 **Receiving waves with an antenna array** – Understand how signals are captured by multiple antenna elements.  
2. 🎯 **Angular resolution of antennas** – Explore how resolution in angle affects our ability to distinguish target echoes.  
3. 🛰️ **Range-azimuth imaging** – Learn how to form a radar image from received signals.  

🛠️ **Your mission:**  
- **Read through the material** in each notebook.  
- **Experiment with the provided code snippets.**  
- **Modify and tweak the examples** to observe how different parameters affect the results.

## **SAR Coding Challenges 🖥️ 👨‍💻** 

In the **`exercises/`** folder, you'll find a set of coding challenge problems designed for different skill levels, organized into three separate Jupyter notebooks:  

📜 **`01_SAR_PADAWANS.ipynb`** – Beginner-level challenges to build a strong foundation.  
⚡ **`02_SAR_MAVERICKS.ipynb`** – Intermediate-level problems to push your skills further.  
🧙‍♂️ **`03_SAR_WIZARDS.ipynb`** – Advanced challenges for the true SAR sorcerers!  

Each notebook contains **detailed instructions** along with **template code** to help you get started. Your task is to **fill in your solutions** to answer the coding questions in each level.  

🔍 **Hint:** Debugging is part of the journey! Keep an eye out for sneaky bugs 🐞 and be ready to refine your code.
