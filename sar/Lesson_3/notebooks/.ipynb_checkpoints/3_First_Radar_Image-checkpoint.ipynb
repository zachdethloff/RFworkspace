    "🏔️ Now, let’s say **a massive rocky cliff** stands in the distance. This cliff **reflects our wave pulse**, sending the wave back toward us.  \n",

    "⏳ We’re paying close attention, and we measure the **time delay** between transmitting the wave and receiving the reflection. That is, we record the **wave height** as a time series at each buoy location.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📡 As the **reflected wavefront** reaches our array, the buoys begin to **wiggle**—but not all at the same time! Since the cliff **isn’t directly ahead**, the wavefront **arrives at an angle**, introducing a slight delay between buoys.  \n",
