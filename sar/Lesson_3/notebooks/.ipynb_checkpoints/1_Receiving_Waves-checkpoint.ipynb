    "\n",
    "So far, we've learned how to **focus the energy** of our wave into a **narrow beam** with an antenna array and how to **measure range** (the distance between the radar and the target) using pulsed signals. But there’s still one crucial piece we haven't really considered: **receiving** waves with our antenna array. 📶  \n",

    "## 📡 Radar Geometry and Beamforming on Receive\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first build an intuition for the geometry of our radar measurements! 🌍 For now, imagine our radar is operating in **flatland**—a simplified 2D world where it's placed on a surface and transmits waves along this plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📏 Setting Up Our Coordinate System\n",
    "To make sense of the measurements, we define our **linear array** as the reference:\n",
    "- 📌 The **x-axis** is aligned with the direction of the array elements.\n",
    "- 📌 The **y-axis** is perpendicular to the array (also defined as the **boresight**, the direction of maximum gain of the antenna).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Range and Azimuth in This System\n",
    "Each of our antenna element can measure **voltage over time**, and we can convert the time delay into **range** (radial distance) using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Range} = \\frac{c \\times \\text{time}}{2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, **azimuth angle** describes the direction relative to the **y-axis (boresight)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this system, **range and azimuth naturally align with polar coordinates**:\n",
    "- 📡 **Range (r)** → The radial distance from the radar, determined by time delay.\n",
    "- 🔄 **Azimuth (θ)** → The angle relative to the y-axis (boresight). We'll soon learn how to determine the **azimuth angle of incoming waves** caused by target echoes!\n",
    "\n",

    "Our goal is to determine **the direction** from which this wave is coming so we can construct an **angular map of our surroundings**. 🎯  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a **wavefront** reaches our buoys, it makes them **rock up and down** according to its **frequency (rhythm) and amplitude (height)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we **measure the height of each buoy** relative to the still water surface at each moment in time. What insights can we extract? 🤔  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **How the Arrival Angle Affects the Buoy Motion**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📍 Case 1: The Wavefront is Head-On**  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a wave approaches **directly from ahead**, its wavefront **aligns perfectly** with the buoy array. In this case, **all buoys rock back and forth in sync**, experiencing **identical motion**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📍 Case 2: The Wavefront Arrives at an Angle**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s consider a **wave arriving at an angle**. 📐 Here’s what happens:  \n",
    "- The **buoy at one edge** of the array encounters the wave **first** and begins rocking. 🌊  \n",
    "- A short moment later, the **next buoy** in line starts rocking.  \n",
    "- This continues **sequentially across the entire array**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all buoys still oscillate with the **same frequency and amplitude**, but **each is slightly out of phase** with its neighbors. 🔄  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **phase difference** between them depends on the **wavefront's angle** relative to the array. The **angle of the wavefront is determined by the azimuth angle of the target** that generated it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To see the most extreme case, imagine a wave arriving **from the side**. If the buoys are placed half-wavelength apart, the phase difference between adjacent buoys would reach exactly **half a wavelength**, as the wave must travel the full **element spacing** before reaching the next buoy. 📏  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "To better understand this effect, experiment with the **interactive code snippet** below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the **angle of the incoming wavefront** (`angle_target_1`) and observe how it **impacts the motion of each buoy**. You'll see that **phasors** are incredibly useful for visualizing the **phase differences between elements**. ⚡  \n",

    "## 📏 Compensating for The Path Length Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Using some trigonometry, we can derive the following formula for the path length difference at any element $n$ : $\\Delta l_{n} = n\\Delta x \\sin{\\theta}$.  To determine the **extra phase shift** at each element, we simply **divide this distance by the wavelength** to obtain the number of cycles. Then we can obtain the corresponding phase angle by multiplying with $2\\pi$. This gives us the phase correction needed to align the signals properly! ⚡📡 \n",
    "\n",
    "To **align the phases** between the antenna elements, we can do the following:  \n",
    "1️⃣ For each element, calculate the **expected phase shift** based on the wave's arrival angle.  \n",
    "2️⃣ Adjust the **phase of the signal** of each element.  \n",
    "3️⃣ Finally, we **sum all of the adjusted signals together**.    \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a wave **actually arrived from the azimuth angle we used in the calculation**, then all of the wavefronts **aligned in phase** and will **add coherently**, reinforcing the signal and creating a strong peak. 📈  \n",
    "- If the wave **came from another direction**, the phase shifts will **not align the waves correctly**, and they won’t sum coherently. ❌"

    "1️⃣ **For each direction (azimuth angle)**, compute the required phase shifts between the elements.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Align the signals** (phasors) of each element accordingly.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Sum them together** to reinforce the signals from the analyzed azimuth direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is analogous to using a **magnifying glass** 🔎 and turning it to examine different directions. The summation acts as the **focusing operation**, just as a lens gathers light waves across its surface into a single point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 But Here’s the Cool Part:  \n",
    "We **don’t need to physically rotate** our \"magnifying glass\"! 🔎 Instead, by applying the **appropriate phase shifts** to the signals recorded by each element, we can **steer our reception beam** in any direction we choose—entirely through **signal processing!** ✨📡  \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a scan across the angular sector, we first capture the element **phasors** at a given moment by sampling the signal over time. 🕰️\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming notebooks, we'll explore how to build a **2D image** combining **range (time-delay)** and **azimuth** information. This is achieved by performing the scan over multiple snapshots, each corresponding to a different time delay. The result? A detailed image that reveals **both the distance and angular position** of objects. 🔍✨\n",

    "Experiment and visualize how we can turn the **gaze of our array** to map out the directions of echoes below. The animation below illustrates the **beamfroming process for a single time snapshot**, obtained by taking a sample (i.e. **recording the amplitude**) of the incoming wavefront for each element.\n",

When the **scanned angle matches the actual target angle**, the subtraction **aligns the phasors** of each element to point in the same direction. If you have a single target, you will see the **red and blue phasors at each element point in the same direction** at the true target azimuth angle. ↗️ \n",
