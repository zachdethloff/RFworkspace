    "## 🔍 Revisiting and Understanding Angular Resolution  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are almost ready to create our **first radar image**, but before that, let’s explore an important concept: **angular resolution**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous experiment, we saw that placing the targets **too close together** in azimuth angle made them mushed together—we could not separate them in the beamforming output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously examined how **antenna size** affects the shape and width of our **antenna beam**. 🔦 Now that we understand **how received waves combine across multiple elements**, let's take a fresh look.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔑 Key Principles to Remember**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **angle of the wavefront** causes **phase differences** across the antenna elements. Our buoys move up and down but at different phases.  \n",
    "- The **beam width** depends on **how many elements** contribute to the combined wave.  \n",
    "  *(If you need a refresher, revisit the Lesson 2 notebooks to see how waves from mulple sources combine to form a beam.)*  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are **summing waves** from different antenna elements, just like we did when we examined the transmitted beam pattern. Thus, the **receiving beam pattern** is **identical** to the **transmit beam pattern**. You might have already noticed this in the beamforming animation in the previous notebook! 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔬 How Close Can We Resolve Two Targets?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **critical factor** is their **angular separation**, since the radar array can only sense **phase differences** between elements, which directly depend on the **wavefront angle**. If two wavefronts come from the **same angle**, there's no way to tell the difference between the waves by comparing the phase shifts between the elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 **Experiment: Adjusting Array Size & Target Distance**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **code snippet below** to investigate **how the array size affects angular resolution**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Place two targets** at different positions in front of the array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Observe how the beamforming response changes** when the targets are closer together.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Change the antenna size** to see how the combined response and resolution changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Try increasing the distance** (y-coordinate) while keeping the **x-coordinates fixed**.  \n",
    "🔹 How does **distance from the radar** affect **resolving power**?  \n",
    "🔹 How close can two targets be before they merge into one?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the experiment and **discover the limits** of our resolution!"

    "\n",
    "The **mainlobe width** of our beam is roughly equal to the **wavelength divided by the antenna diameter**.\n",

    "Mathematically, the beam pattern follows what is known as a **sinc function**: $\\text{sinc}(x) = \\sin(x)/x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function describes the shape of the beam, with the **mainlobe** at the center and **sidelobes** diminishing in amplitude as you move outward. 📶\n",
    "\n",
    "If two targets are **closer together** than **half the width** of the **mainlobe**, their waves become so closely **merged** that we can no longer distinguish them. In the **angular map**, their responses blur together, making them **indistinguishable**.  🌫️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **How Distance Affects Resolution**  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 By changing the target distance from the radar, you may have noticed an important fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Since the **array resolves incoming waves by azimuth angle**, the **resolution in the horizontal x-axis direction** depends on the **distance to the target**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **For targets closer to the radar**, we achieve **better horizontal resolution**.  \n",
    "- **For targets further away**, we have **poorer horizontal resolution**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **📡 Why Does This Happen?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- When targets are **close to the radar**, even a **small horizontal separation** creates a **clear azimuth angle difference** for the incoming wavefronts.  \n",
    "- When targets are **far away**, the **same horizontal separation** produces a **much smaller difference in their azimuth angle**, making them harder to distinguish.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **📏 Cross-Range Resolution & Distance**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **horizontal direction**, which runs along the **radar array** (x-axis in our plots), is also known as **cross-range** in radar terminology. 📡📏  \n",

    "📌 We have just discovered an important principle:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The cross-range resolution of a real aperture radar depends on the target's distance from the radar!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that **closer targets can be resolved with finer detail**, while **farther targets appear more blurred in the cross-range dimension**. 📡  \n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
