# ðŸ“¡ Lesson 3: Beamforming and 2D Mapping with Radar 

Welcome to **Lesson 3** of the **SAR Training Course**! In this lesson, we delve into the **fundamental principles** behind **direction finding** and **angular resolution** in radar arrays.

---

## **ðŸ“– Overview**
In this lesson, we will explore the **core physics** behind radar signals, including:

âœ… **Direction Finding** â€“ How an antenna array can determine the direction of incoming wavefronts.  
âœ… **Angular Resolution** â€“ How we can separate multiple overlapping waves and accurately map their directions.  
âœ… **2D Radar Mapping** â€“ How we can use a pulsed signal and an antenna array to create **range-angle images** of the environment.  

By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of **how radar imaging** works using a real aperture.

Get ready to **dive deeper** into beamforming and radar-based environmental mapping! ðŸ“¡
