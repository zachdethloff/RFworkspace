    "# 🔭 Resolution, Pulse Duration, and Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned that **range resolution** depends on the **pulse duration**. If the pulse is **too long**, echoes from nearby targets can **overlap**, arriving at the receiver **simultaneously**—making it **impossible to distinguish them**. 🚫👀\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a catch! A radar transmitter can only output a certain **maximum power**, typically operating **close to that limit**. If we **shorten** the pulse to enhance resolution, we reduce the **total transmitted energy**, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Energy} = \\text{Power} \\times \\text{Time} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when the **pulse duration decreases**, the total **energy also decreases**. 👎\n",
    "\n",
    "To boost **energy**, we would need to transmit a **longer pulse**. 🔋\n",
    "\n",
    "To **see far** with our radar, we need:\n",
    "- ✅ **High energy** in the pulse (more energy = greater detection range).\n",
    "- ✅ **Minimal noise** in the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait—there's more! Decreasing pulse duration means the receiver must **sample the signal faster**. This higher sampling rate **lets in more noise**, which isn't great for detecting faint signals. 😬\n",
    "\n",
    "It's all a balancing act between **resolution**, **total energy**, and **noise**! ⚖️\n",

    "2️⃣ **Long, Gentle Push** ⏳  \n",
    "   - Instead of one hard push, you **push gently over a longer time**.  \n",
    "   - Even though each moment’s push is weaker, the swing **gradually accumulates energy** and reaches the **same final height**.  \n",
