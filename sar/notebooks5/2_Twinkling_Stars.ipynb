    "Here's how we do it, step-by-step:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Calculate the Range (Time Delay)** 📏⏳  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the radar **transmits a pulse**, it travels all the way to the pixel location and some energy is reflected back. 🔦🪞  \n",
    "\n",
    "The energy reflected by the pixel location appears at a certain **time delay** in our data, determined by the **distance between the radar and the pixel location** at the given measurement position.\n",

    "- The different **virtual antenna elements** correspond to different time $t$ values along our **orbital trajectory**.  \n",

    "- The echo signals from our pixel have traveled **different distances** for each pulse. 🚀  \n",
    "- If we just added them up as they are, they'd sum in random phases and our beam would not focus properly. ❌  \n",

    "✅ **What we need to do:** Apply a **phase correction** to each signal based on the calculated range to the pixel. This ensures that all the signals will add up constructively, producing a strong focused signal. 🌟  \n",

    "- This is very similar to what we already did in **Lesson 3**! The difference is, we're **not making any plane wave or far-field assumptions**.  \n",

    "- The difference compared to our phased array in Lesson 3 is that the time delays and phase shifts **are not constant** between the virtual elements. 📈\n",
